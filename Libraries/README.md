# CapacitiveSensor Library

Capacitive Sensing Library by Paul Badger

https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/CapacitiveSensor

CapcitiveSensor library turns two or more Arduino pins into a capacitive sensor, which can sense the electrical capacitance of the human body. All the sensor setup requires is a medium to high value resistor and a piece of wire and a small (to large) piece of aluminum foil on the end. At its most sensitive, the sensor will start to sense a hand or body inches away from the sensor.
